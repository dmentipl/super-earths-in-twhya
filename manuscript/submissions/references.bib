	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (0farcs3 = 16 AU), high signal-to-noise ratio Submillimeter Array observations of the 870 mum (345 GHz) continuum and CO J = 3 - 2 line emission from the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya. Using continuum and line radiative transfer calculations, these data and the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution are analyzed together in the context of simple two-dimensional parametric disk structure models. Under the assumptions of a radially invariant dust population and gas-to-dust mass ratio, we are unable to simultaneously reproduce the CO and dust observations with model structures that employ either a single, distinct outer boundary or a smooth (exponential) taper at large radii. Instead, we find that the distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains in the TW Hya disk has a relatively sharp edge near 60 AU, contrary to the CO emission (and optical/infrared scattered light) that extends to a much larger radius of at least 215 AU. We discuss some possible explanations for the observed radial distribution of millimeter-sized dust grains and the apparent CO-dust size discrepancy, and suggest that they may be hallmarks of substructure in the dust disk or natural signatures of the growth and radial drift of solids that might be expected for disks around older pre-main-sequence stars like TW Hya.},

	Abstract = {We present long baseline Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the 870 mum continuum emission from the nearest gas-rich protoplanetary disk, around TW Hya, that trace millimeter-sized particles down to spatial scales as small as 1 au (20 mas). These data reveal a series of concentric ring-shaped substructures in the form of bright zones and narrow dark annuli (1-6 au) with modest contrasts (5%-30%). We associate these features with concentrations of solids that have had their inward radial drift slowed or stopped, presumably at local gas pressure maxima. No significant non-axisymmetric structures are detected. Some of the observed features occur near temperatures that may be associated with the condensation fronts of major volatile species, but the relatively small brightness contrasts may also be a consequence of magnetized disk evolution (the so-called zonal flows). Other features, particularly a narrow dark annulus located only 1 au from the star, could indicate interactions between the disk and young planets. These data signal that ordered substructures on ˜au scales can be common, fundamental factors in disk evolution and that high-resolution microwave imaging can help characterize them during the epoch of planet formation.},

	Abstract = {We have performed three-dimensional two-fluid (gas-dust) hydrodynamical models of circumstellar discs with embedded protoplanets (3-333 M⊕) and small solid bodies (radii 10 cm to 10 m). We find that high-mass planets (≳ Saturn mass) open sufficiently deep gaps in the gas disc such that the density maximum at the outer edge of the gap can very efficiently trap metre-sized solid bodies. This allows the accumulation of solids at the outer edge of the gap as solids from large radii spiral inwards to the trapping region. This process of accumulation occurs fastest for those bodies that spiral inwards most rapidly, typically metre-sized boulders, whilst smaller and larger objects will not migrate sufficiently rapidly in the discs lifetime to benefit from the process. Around a Jupiter mass planet we find that bound clumps of solid material, as large as several Earth masses, may form, potentially collapsing under self-gravity to form planets or planetesimals. These results are in agreement with Lyra et al., supporting their finding that the formation of a second generation of planetesimals or of terrestrial mass planets may be triggered by the presence of a high-mass planet.},

	Abstract = {Aims.We have estimated the age of the young moving group TW Hydrae Association, a cohort of a few dozen stars and brown dwarfs located near the Sun which share the same kinematic properties and, presumably, the same origin and age. Methods: .The chronology has been determined by analyzing different properties (magnitudes, colors, activity, lithium) of its members and comparing them with several well-known star forming regions and open clusters, as well as theoretical models. In addition, by using medium-resolution optical spectra of two M8 members of the association (2M1139 and 2M1207 - an accreting brown dwarf with a planetary mass companion), we have derived spectral types and measured Halpha and lithium equivalent widths. We have also estimated their effective temperature and gravity, which were used to produce an independent age estimation for these two brown dwarfs. We have also collected spectra of 2M1315, a candidate member with a L5 spectral type and measured its Halpha equivalent width. Results: .Our age estimate for the association, 10+10-7 Myr, agrees with previous values cited in the literature. In the case of the two brown dwarfs, we have derived an age of 15+15-10 Myr, which also agree with our estimate for the whole group. Conclusions: .We compared our results with recent articles published on the same subject using other techniques, and discuss the limits of the age-dating techniques.},

@article{bate:1995,
	Abstract = {A method for following fragmentation simulations further in time using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is presented. In a normal SPH simulation of the collapse and fragmentation of a molecular cloud, high-density regions of gas that form protostars are represented by many particles with small separations. These high-density regions require small time-steps, limiting the time for which the simulation can be followed. Thus, the end result of the fragmentation can never be definitively ascertained, and comparisons between cloud fragmentation calculations and the observed characteristics of stellar systems cannot be made. In this paper, each high-density region is replaced by a single, non-gaseous particle, with appropriate boundary conditions, which contains all the mass in the region and accretes any infalling mass. This enables the evolution of the cloud and the resulting protostars to be followed for many orbits or until most of the original cloud mass has been accreted. The Boss & Bodenheimer standard isothermal test case for the fragmentation of an interstellar cloud is used as an example for the technique. It is found that the binary protostellar system that forms initially does not merge, but instead forms a multiple system. The collapse is followed to four initial cloud free-fall times when approximately 80 per cent of the original mass of the cloud has been accreted by the protostars, or surrounds them in discs, and the remainder of the material has been expelled out to the radius of the initial cloud by the binary.},

@article{bergin:2013,
	Abstract = {From the masses of the planets orbiting the Sun, and the abundance of elements relative to hydrogen, it is estimated that when the Solar System formed, the circumstellar disk must have had a minimum mass of around 0.01 solar masses within about 100 astronomical units of the star. (One astronomical unit is the Earth-Sun distance.) The main constituent of the disk, gaseous molecular hydrogen, does not efficiently emit radiation from the disk mass reservoir, and so the most common measure of the disk mass is dust thermal emission and lines of gaseous carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide emission generally indicates properties of the disk surface, and the conversion from dust emission to gas mass requires knowledge of the grain properties and the gas-to-dust mass ratio, which probably differ from their interstellar values. As a result, mass estimates vary by orders of magnitude, as exemplified by the relatively old (3-10 million years) star TW Hydrae, for which the range is 0.0005-0.06 solar masses. Here we report the detection of the fundamental rotational transition of hydrogen deuteride from the direction of TW Hydrae. Hydrogen deuteride is a good tracer of disk gas because it follows the distribution of molecular hydrogen and its emission is sensitive to the total mass. The detection of hydrogen deuteride, combined with existing observations and detailed models, implies a disk mass of more than 0.05 solar masses, which is enough to form a planetary system like our own.},

	Abstract = {Context. Recent observations have revealed organised structures in protoplanetary discs, such as axisymmetric rings or horseshoe concentrations, evocative of large-scale vortices. These structures are often interpreted as the result of planet-disc interactions. However, these discs are also known to be unstable to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) which is believed to be one of the dominant angular momentum transport mechanism in these objects. It is therefore natural to ask whether the MRI itself could produce these structures without invoking planets.  Aims: The nonlinear evolution of the MRI is strongly affected by the low ionisation fraction in protoplanetary discs. The Hall effect in particular, which is dominant in dense and weakly ionised parts of these objects, has been shown to spontaneously drive self-organising flows in local, shearing box simulations. Here, we investigate the behaviour of global MRI-unstable disc models dominated by the Hall effect and characterise their dynamics.  Methods: We validated our implementation of the Hall effect into the PLUTO code with predictions from a spectral method in cylindrical geometry. We then performed 3D unstratified Hall-MHD simulations of Keplerian discs for a broad range of Hall, Ohmic, and ambipolar Elsasser numbers.  Results: We confirm the transition from a turbulent to an organised state as the intensity of the Hall effect is increased. We observe the formation of zonal flows, their number depending on the available magnetic flux and on the intensity of the Hall effect. For intermediate Hall intensity, the flow self-organises into long-lived magnetised vortices. Neither the addition of a toroidal field nor Ohmic or ambipolar diffusion change this picture drastically in the range of parameters we have explored.  Conclusions: Self-organisation by the Hall effect is a robust phenomenon in global non-stratified simulations. It is able to quench turbulent transport and spontaneously produce axisymmetric rings or sustained vortices. The ability of these structures to trap dust particles in this configuration is demonstrated. We conclude that Hall-MRI driven organisation is a plausible scenario that could explain some of the structures found in recent observations.},

	Abstract = {The growth of a planetary core by pebble accretion stops at the so-called pebble isolation mass, when the core generates a pressure bump that traps drifting pebbles outside its orbit. The value of the pebble isolation mass is crucial in determining the final planet mass. If the isolation mass is very low, gas accretion is protracted and the planet remains at a few Earth masses with a mainly solid composition. For higher values of the pebble isolation mass, the planet might be able to accrete gas from the protoplanetary disc and grow into a gas giant. Previous works have determined a scaling of the pebble isolation mass with cube of the disc aspect ratio. Here, we expand on previous measurements and explore the dependency of the pebble isolation mass on all relevant parameters of the protoplanetary disc. We use 3D hydrodynamical simulations to measure the pebble isolation mass and derive a simple scaling law that captures the dependence on the local disc structure and the turbulent viscosity parameter alpha. We find that small pebbles, coupled to the gas, with Stokes number tauf < 0.005 can drift through the partial gap at pebble isolation mass. However, as the planetary mass increases, particles must be decreasingly smaller to penetrate the pressure bump. Turbulent diffusion of particles, however, can lead to an increase of the pebble isolation mass by a factor of two, depending on the strength of the background viscosity and on the pebble size. We finally explore the implications of the new scaling law of the pebble isolation mass on the formation of planetary systems by numerically integrating the growth and migration pathways of planets in evolving protoplanetary discs. Compared to models neglecting the dependence of the pebble isolation mass on the alpha-viscosity, our models including this effect result in higher core masses for giant planets. These higher core masses are more similar to the core masses of the giant planets in the solar system.},

	Abstract = {Diagnostics of electron temperature (Te ), electron density (ne ), and hydrogen column density (N H) from the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating spectrum of He-like Ne IX in TW Hydrae (TW Hya), in conjunction with a classical accretion model, allow us to infer the accretion rate onto the star directly from measurements of the accreting material. The new method introduces the use of the absorption of Ne IX lines as a measure of the column density of the intervening, accreting material. On average, the derived mass accretion rate for TW Hya is 1.5 × 10-9 M &sun; yr-1, for a stellar magnetic field strength of 600 G and a filling factor of 3.5%. Three individual Chandra exposures show statistically significant differences in the Ne IX line ratios, indicating changes in N H, Te , and ne by factors of 0.28, 1.6, and 1.3, respectively. In exposures separated by 2.7 days, the observations reported here suggest a five-fold reduction in the accretion rate. This powerful new technique promises to substantially improve our understanding of the accretion process in young stars.},

@article{calvet:2002,
	Abstract = {We have developed a physically self-consistent model of the disk around the nearby 10 Myr old star TW Hya that matches the observed spectral energy distribution and 7 mm images of the disk. The model requires both significant dust-size evolution and a partially evacuated inner disk region, as predicted by theories of planet formation. The outer disk, which extends to at least 140 AU in radius, is very optically thick at infrared wavelengths and quite massive (~0.06 Msolar) for the relatively advanced age of this T Tauri star. This implies long viscous and dust evolution timescales, although dust must have grown to sizes of the order of ~1 cm to explain the submillimeter and millimeter spectral slopes. In contrast, the negligible near-infrared excess emission of this system requires that the disk be optically thin inside <~4 AU. This inner region cannot be completely evacuated; we need ~0.5 lunar mass of ~1 mum particles remaining to produce the observed 10 mum silicate emission. Our model requires a distinct transition in disk properties at ~4 AU separating the inner and outer disks. The inner edge of the optically thick outer disk must be heated almost frontally by the star to account for the excess flux at mid-infrared wavelengths. We speculate that this truncation of the outer disk may be the signpost of a developing gap due to the effects of a growing protoplanet; the gap is still presumably evolving because material still resides in it, as indicated by the silicate emission, the molecular hydrogen emission, and the continued accretion onto the central star (albeit at a much lower rate than typical of younger T Tauri stars). Thus, TW Hya may become the Rosetta stone for our understanding of the evolution and dissipation of protoplanetary disks.},

	Abstract = {We present a 0.5-2.2 mum scattered light spectrum of the circumstellar disk around TW Hya from a combination of spatially resolved Hubble Space Telescope STIS spectroscopy and NICMOS coronagraphic images of the disk. We investigate the morphology of the disk at distances >40 AU over this wide range of wavelengths, and identify the presence of a depression in surface brightness at ~80 AU that could be caused by a gap in the disk. Additionally, we quantify the surface brightness, azimuthal symmetry, and spectral character of the disk as a function of radius. Our analysis shows that the scattering efficiency of the dust is largely neutral to blue over the observed wavelengths. We model the disk as a steady alpha-disk with an ad hoc gap structure. The thermal properties of the disk are self-consistently calculated using a three-dimensional radiative transfer code that uses ray tracing to model the heating of the disk interior and scattered light images. We find a good fit to the data over a wide range of distances from the star if we use a model disk with a partially filled gap of 30% depth at 80 AU and with a self-similar truncation knee at 100 AU. The origin of the gap is unclear, but it could arise from a transition in the nature of the disk's dust composition or the presence of a planetary companion. Based on scalings to previous hydrodynamic simulations of gap-opening criteria for embedded proto-planets, we estimate that a planetary companion forming the gap could have a mass between 6 and 28 M ⊕.

These HST/STIS observations achieved an inner working angle of ~0."2, or 11.7 au, probing the system at angular radii coincident with recent images of the disk obtained by ALMA and in polarized intensity near-infrared light. By comparing our new STIS images to those taken with STIS in 2000 and with NICMOS in 1998, 2004, and 2005, we demonstrate that TW Hya's azimuthal surface brightness asymmetry moves coherently in position angle. Between 50 au and 141 au we measure a constant angular velocity in the azimuthal brightness asymmetry of 22.$\,^{\circ}$7 yr-1 in a counterclockwise direction, equivalent to a period of 15.9 yr assuming circular motion. Both the (short) inferred period and lack of radial dependence of the moving shadow pattern are inconsistent with Keplerian rotation at these disk radii. We hypothesize that the asymmetry arises from the fact that the disk interior to 1 au is inclined and precessing owing to a planetary companion, thus partially shadowing the outer disk. Further monitoring of this and other shadows on protoplanetary disks potentially opens a new avenue for indirectly observing the sites of planet formation.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

	Abstract = {We explain the axisymmetric gaps seen in recent long-baseline observations of the HL Tau protoplanetary disc with the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) as being due to the different response of gas and dust to embedded planets in protoplanetary discs. We perform global, three-dimensional dusty smoothed particle hydrodynamics calculations of multiple planets embedded in dust/gas discs which successfully reproduce most of the structures seen in the ALMA image. We find a best match to the observations using three embedded planets with masses of 0.2, 0.27 and 0.55 MJ in the three main gaps observed by ALMA, though there remain uncertainties in the exact planet masses from the disc model.},

	Abstract = {We identify two distinct physical mechanisms for dust gap opening by embedded planets in protoplanetary discs based on the symmetry of the drag-induced motion around the planet: (I) a mechanism where low-mass planets, that do not disturb the gas, open gaps in dust by tidal torques assisted by drag in the inner disc, but resisted by drag in the outer disc; and (II) the usual, drag-assisted, mechanism where higher mass planets create pressure maxima in the gas disc, which the drag torque then acts to evacuate further in the dust. The first mechanism produces gaps in dust but not gas, while the second produces partial or total gas gaps which are deeper in the dust phase. Dust gaps do not necessarily indicate gas gaps.},

	Abstract = {High-contrast imaging instruments such as GPI and SPHERE are discovering gap structures in protoplanetary disks at an ever faster pace. Some of these gaps may be opened by planets forming in the disks. In order to constrain planet formation models using disk observations, it is crucial to find a robust way to quantitatively back out the properties of the gap-opening planets, in particular their masses, from the observed gap properties, such as their depths and widths. Combining 2D and 3D hydrodynamics simulations with 3D radiative transfer simulations, we investigate the morphology of planet-opened gaps in near-infrared scattered-light images. Quantitatively, we obtain correlations that directly link intrinsic gap depths and widths in the gas surface density to observed depths and widths in images of disks at modest inclinations under finite angular resolution. Subsequently, the properties of the surface density gaps enable us to derive the disk scale height at the location of the gap h, and to constrain the quantity Mp2/alpha, where Mp is the mass of the gap-opening planet and alpha characterizes the viscosity in the gap. As examples, we examine the gaps recently imaged by VLT/SPHERE, Gemini/GPI, and Subaru/HiCIAO in HD 97048, TW Hya, HD 169142, LkCa 15, and RX J1615.3-3255. Scale heights of the disks and possible masses of the gap-opening planets are derived assuming each gap is opened by a single planet. Assuming alpha = 10-3, the derived planet masses in all cases are roughly between 0.1 and 1 MJ.},

	Abstract = {Large cavities are often observed in protoplanetary disks, which might suggest the presence of planets opening gaps in the disk. Multiple planets are necessary to produce a wide cavity in the gas. However, multiple planets may also be a burden to the carving out of very deep gaps. When additional planets are added to the system, the time-dependent perturbations from these additional satellites can stir up gas in the gap, suppressing cavity opening. In this study, we perform two-dimensional numerical hydro calculations of gap opening for single and multiple planets, showing the effect that additional planets have on the gap depths. We show that multiple planets produce much shallower cavities than single planets, so that more massive planets are needed in the multiple-planet case to produce an equivalent gap depth as in the single-planet case. To deplete a gap by a factor of 100 for the parameters chosen in this study, one only requires Mp ≈ 3.5 MJ in the single-planet case, but much more massive planets, Mp ≈ 7 MJ are required in the multiple-planet case. This requirement of high-mass planets implies that such planets may be detectable in the next generation of direct imaging projects, in gaps whose depths are constrained to be sufficiently deep by ALMA.},

	Abstract = {Kinetic theory of the resistance to a sphere moving through a gas.- (1) Droplets small in comparison with the mean free path. The high degree of accuracy achieved in the experimental determination of the law of motions of droplets through gases, makes a careful theoretical examination of the problem desirable. Assuming the usual Maxwellian distribution of velocities in the gas, the force exerted by the impinging molecules is found to be M where M=(4pi3) Nma2cmV, N, m, a, and cm being the number per unit volume, mass, radius, and mean speed of the molecules and V the speed of the droplet. The force exerted by the molecules leaving the surface depends on how they leave. (1) For uniform evaporation from the whole surface, the force is -M; (2) for specular reflection of all the impinging molecules, -M; (3) for diffuse reflection with unchanged distribution of velocities, -(139)M; (4) for diffuse reflection with the Maxwell distribution corresponding to the effective temperature of the part of the surface they come from, -(1+9pi64)M, for a non-conducting droplet (4a), and -(1+pi8)M, for a perfectly conducting droplet (4b). Cases (1) and (2) can not be distinguished experimentally, but (2) is more probable physically. The experimental values agree with 1/10 specular reflection, case (2), and 9/10 diffuse reflection, case (4a) or (4b). For large values of la, the droplet behaves like a perfect conductor, case (4b). (2) Comparatively large spheres. The distribution of velocities is no longer Maxwellian because of the hydrodynamic stresses which can not now be neglected. The new law is derived (Eq. 47). The conditions at the surface of the sphere are discussed and it is shown that the diffusely reflected molecules have a Maxwellian distribution corresponding to the temperature and density of the gas, just as though they were reflected with conservation of velocity (specularly). The assumptions of Bassett are theoretically justified and a complete confirmation is obtained for the correction factor for Stokes' law [1+0.7004 (2s-1) (la)] on which Millikan's conclusions are based, especially as to the percentage of specular reflection. (3) Rotating spheres are also considered in an appendix, and the values of the resistance are derived for various cases.},

	Abstract = {Turbulence is a fundamental parameter in models of grain growth during the early stages of planet formation. As such, observational constraints on its magnitude are crucial. Here we self-consistently analyze ALMA CO(2--1), SMA CO(3--2), and SMA CO(6--5) observations of the disk around TW Hya and find an upper limit on the turbulent broadening of <0.08c  s  (alpha < 0.007 for alpha defined only within 2--3 pressure scale heights above the midplane), lower than the tentative detection previously found from an analysis of the CO(2--1) data. We examine in detail the challenges of image plane fitting versus directly fitting the visibilities, while also considering the role of the vertical temperature gradient, systematic uncertainty in the amplitude calibration, and assumptions about the CO abundance, as potential sources of the discrepancy in the turbulence measurements. These tests result in variations of the turbulence limit between <0.04c  s  and <0.13c  s , consistently lower than the 0.2--0.4c  s  found previously. Having ruled out numerous factors, we restrict the source of the discrepancy to our assumed coupling between temperature and density through hydrostatic equilibrium in the presence of a vertical temperature gradient and/or the confinement of CO to a thin molecular layer above the midplane, although further work is needed to quantify the influence of these prescriptions. Assumptions about hydrostatic equilibrium and the CO distribution are physically motivated, and may have a small influence on measuring the kinematics of the gas, but they become important when constraining small effects such as the strength of the turbulence within a protoplanetary disk.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Recent observations by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of disks around young stars revealed distinct asymmetries in the dust continuum emission. In this work we wish to study axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric structures that are generated by the magneto-rotational instability in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks. We combine the results of state-of-the-art numerical simulations with post-processing radiative transfer (RT) to generate synthetic maps and predictions for ALMA.  Methods: We performed non-ideal global 3D magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) stratified simulations of the dead-zone outer edge using the FARGO MHD code PLUTO. The stellar and disk parameters were taken from a parameterized disk model applied for fitting high-angular resolution multi-wavelength observations of various circumstellar disks. We considered a stellar mass of M* = 0.5 M&sun; and a total disk mass of about 0.085 M*. The 2D initial temperature and density profiles were calculated consistently from a given surface density profile and Monte Carlo radiative transfer. The 2D Ohmic resistivity profile was calculated using a dust chemistry model. We considered two values for the dust-to-gas mass ratio, 10-2 and 10-4, which resulted in two different levels of magnetic coupling. The initial magnetic field was a vertical net flux field. The radiative transfer simulations were performed with the Monte Carlo-based 3D continuum RT code MC3D. The resulting dust reemission provided the basis for the simulation of observations with ALMA.  Results: All models quickly turned into a turbulent state. The fiducial model with a dust-to-gas mass ratio of 10-2 developed a large gap followed by a jump in surface density located at the dead-zone outer edge. The jump in density and pressure was strong enough to stop the radial drift of particles at this location. In addition, we observed the generation of vortices by the Rossby wave instability at the jump location close to 60 AU. The vortices were steadily generated and destroyed at a cycle of 40 local orbits. The RT results and simulated ALMA observations predict that it is feasible to observe these large-scale structures that appear in magnetized disks without planets. Neither the turbulent fluctuations in the disk nor specific times of the model can be distinguished on the basis of high-angular resolution submillimeter observations alone. The same applies to the distinction between gaps at the dead-zone edges and planetary gaps, to the distinction between turbulent and simple unperturbed disks, and to the asymmetry created by the vortex.},

	Abstract = {Gaia is a cornerstone mission in the science programme of the EuropeanSpace Agency (ESA). The spacecraft construction was approved in 2006, following a study in which the original interferometric concept was changed to a direct-imaging approach. Both the spacecraft and the payload were built by European industry. The involvement of the scientific community focusses on data processing for which the international Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) was selected in 2007. Gaia was launched on 19 December 2013 and arrived at its operating point, the second Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth-Moon system, a few weeks later. The commissioning of the spacecraft and payload was completed on 19 July 2014. The nominal five-year mission started with four weeks of special, ecliptic-pole scanning and subsequently transferred into full-sky scanning mode. We recall the scientific goals of Gaia and give a description of the as-built spacecraft that is currently (mid-2016) being operated to achieve these goals. We pay special attention to the payload module, the performance of which is closely related to the scientific performance of the mission. We provide a summary of the commissioning activities and findings, followed by a description of the routine operational mode. We summarise scientific performance estimates on the basis of in-orbit operations. Several intermediate Gaia data releases are planned and the data can be retrieved from the Gaia Archive, which is available through the Gaia home page.  http://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia},

	Abstract = {Context. We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system.  Aims: A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results.  Methods: The raw data collected with the Gaia instruments during the first 22 months of the mission have been processed by the Gaia Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (DPAC) and turned into this second data release, which represents a major advance with respect to Gaia DR1 in terms of completeness, performance, and richness of the data products.  Results: Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the GBP (330-680 nm) and GRP (630-1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14 000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.  Conclusions: Gaia DR2 represents a major achievement for the Gaia mission, delivering on the long standing promise to provide parallaxes and proper motions for over 1 billion stars, and representing a first step in the availability of complementary radial velocity and source astrophysical information for a sample of stars in the Gaia survey which covers a very substantial fraction of the volume of our galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Planet formation is thought to occur in discs around young stars by the aggregation of small dust grains into much larger objects. The growth from grains to pebbles and from planetesimals to planets is now fairly well understood. The intermediate stage has however been found to be hindered by the radial-drift and fragmentation barriers. We identify a powerful mechanism in which dust overcomes both barriers. Its key ingredients are i) backreaction from the dust onto the gas, ii) grain growth and fragmentation, and iii) large-scale gradients. The pile-up of growing and fragmenting grains modifies the gas structure on large scales and triggers the formation of pressure maxima, in which particles are trapped. We show that these self-induced dust traps are robust: they develop for a wide range of disc structures, fragmentation thresholds and initial dust-to-gas ratios. They are favored locations for pebbles to grow into planetesimals, thus opening new paths towards the formation of planets.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of the first sensitive L-band survey of the intermediate-age (2.5-30 Myr) clusters NGC 2264, NGC 2362, and NGC 1960. We use JHKL colors to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fractions in each cluster. We find disk fractions of 52%+/-10%, 12%+/-4%, and 3%+/-3% for the three clusters, respectively. Together with our previously published JHKL investigations of the younger NGC 2024, Trapezium, and IC 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (>=80%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in <~3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of ~6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We analyze high angular resolution ALMA observations of the TW Hya disk to place constraints on the CO and dust properties. We present new, sensitive observations of the 12CO J = 3 - 2 line at a spatial resolution of 8 au (0."14). The CO emission exhibits a bright inner core, a shoulder at r ≈ 70 au, and a prominent break in slope at r ≈ 90 au. Radiative transfer modeling is used to demonstrate that the emission morphology can be reasonably reproduced with a 12CO column density profile featuring a steep decrease at r ≈ 15 au and a secondary bump peaking at r ≈ 70 au. Similar features have been identified in observations of rarer CO isotopologues, which trace heights closer to the midplane. Substructure in the underlying gas distribution or radially varying CO depletion that affects much of the disk's vertical extent may explain the shared emission features of the main CO isotopologues. We also combine archival 1.3 mm and 870 mum continuum observations to produce a spectral index map at a spatial resolution of 2 au. The spectral index rises sharply at the continuum emission gaps at radii of 25, 41, and 47 au. This behavior suggests that the grains within the gaps are no larger than a few millimeters. Outside the continuum gaps, the low spectral index values of alpha ≈ 2 indicate either that grains up to centimeter size are present or that the bright continuum rings are marginally optically thick at millimeter wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm, MULTIGRAIN, for modelling the dynamics of an entire population of small dust grains immersed in gas, typical of conditions that are found in molecular clouds and protoplanetary discs. The MULTIGRAIN method is more accurate than single-phase simulations because the gas experiences a backreaction from each dust phase and communicates this change to the other phases, thereby indirectly coupling the dust phases together. The MULTIGRAIN method is fast, explicit and low storage, requiring only an array of dust fractions and their derivatives defined for each resolution element.},

	Abstract = {We study the behavior of magnetorotational turbulence in shearing box simulations with a radial and azimuthal extent up to 10 scale heights. Maxwell and Reynolds stresses are found to increase by more than a factor of 2 when increasing the box size beyond two scale heights in the radial direction. Further increase of the box size has little or no effect on the statistical properties of the turbulence. An inverse cascade excites magnetic field structures at the largest scales of the box. The corresponding 10% variation in the Maxwell stress launches a zonal flow of alternating sub- and super-Keplerian velocity. This, in turn, generates a banded density structure in geostrophic balance between pressure and Coriolis forces. We present a simplified model for the appearance of zonal flows, in which stochastic forcing by the magnetic tension on short timescales creates zonal flow structures with lifetimes of several tens of orbits. We experiment with various improved shearing box algorithms to reduce the numerical diffusivity introduced by the supersonic shear flow. While a standard finite difference advection scheme shows signs of a suppression of turbulent activity near the edges of the box, this problem is eliminated by a new method where the Keplerian shear advection is advanced in time by interpolation in Fourier space.},

	Abstract = {Context. The gas-solid budget of carbon in protoplanetary disks is related to the composition of the cores and atmospheres of the planets forming in them. The principal gas-phase carbon carriers CO, C0, and C+ can now be observed regularly in disks.  Aims: The gas-phase carbon abundance in disks has thus far not been well characterized observationally. We obtain new constraints on the [C]/[H] ratio in a large sample of disks, and compile an overview of the strength of [C i] and warm CO emission.  Methods: We carried out a survey of the CO 6-5 line and the [C i] 1-0 and 2-1 lines towards 37 disks with the APEX telescope, and supplemented it with [C ii] data from the literature. The data are interpreted using a grid of models produced with the DALI disk code. We also investigate how well the gas-phase carbon abundance can be determined in light of parameter uncertainties.  Results: The CO 6-5 line is detected in 13 out of 33 sources, [C i] 1-0 in 6 out of 12, and [C i] 2-1 in 1 out of 33. With separate deep integrations, the first unambiguous detections of the [C i] 1-0 line in disks are obtained, in TW Hya and HD 100546.  Conclusions: Gas-phase carbon abundance reductions of a factor of 5-10 or more can be identified robustly based on CO and [C i] detections, assuming reasonable constraints on other parameters. The atomic carbon detection towards TW Hya confirms a factor of 100 reduction of [C]/[H]gas in that disk, while the data are consistent with an ISM-like carbon abundance for HD 100546. In addition, BP Tau, T Cha, HD 139614, HD 141569, and HD 100453 are either carbon-depleted or gas-poor disks. The low [C i] 2-1 detection rates in the survey mostly reflect insufficient sensitivity for T Tauri disks. The Herbig Ae/Be disks with CO and [C ii] upper limits below the models are debris-disk-like systems. An increase in sensitivity of roughly order of magnitude compared to our survey is required to obtain useful constraints on the gas-phase [C]/[H] ratio in most of the targeted systems.

	Abstract = {Star and planet formation are the complex outcomes of gravitational collapse and angular momentum transport mediated by protostellar and protoplanetary disks. In this review, we focus on the role of gravitational instability in this process. We begin with a brief overview of the observational evidence for massive disks that might be subject to gravitational instability and then highlight the diverse ways in which the instability manifests itself in protostellar and protoplanetary disks: the generation of spiral arms, small-scale turbulence-like density fluctuations, and fragmentation of the disk itself. We present the analytic theory that describes the linear growth phase of the instability supplemented with a survey of numerical simulations that aim to capture the nonlinear evolution. We emphasize the role of thermodynamics and large-scale infall in controlling the outcome of the instability. Despite apparent controversies in the literature, we show a remarkable level of agreement between analytic predictions and numerical results. In the next part of our review, we focus on the astrophysical consequences of the instability. We show that the disks most likely to be gravitationally unstable are young and relatively massive compared with their host star, Md/M*>=0.1. They will develop quasi-stable spiral arms that process infall from the background cloud. Although instability is less likely at later times, once infall becomes less important, the manifestations of the instability are more varied. In this regime, the disk thermodynamics, often regulated by stellar irradiation, dictates the development and evolution of the instability. In some cases the instability may lead to fragmentation into bound companions. These companions are more likely to be brown dwarfs or stars than planetary mass objects. Finally, we highlight open questions related to the development of a turbulent cascade in thin disks and the role of mode-mode coupling in setting the maximum angular momentum transport rate in thick disks.},

	Abstract = {We present a new algorithm for simulating two-fluid gas and dust mixtures in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), systematically addressing a number of key issues including the generalized SPH density estimate in multifluid systems, the consistent treatment of variable smoothing-length terms, finite particle size, timestep stability, thermal coupling terms and the choice of kernel and smoothing length used in the drag operator. We find that using double-hump-shaped kernels improves the accuracy of the drag interpolation by a factor of several hundred compared to the use of standard SPH bell-shaped kernels, at no additional computational expense. In order to benchmark our algorithm, we have developed a comprehensive suite of standardized, simple test problems for gas and dust mixtures: DUSTYBOX, DUSTYWAVE, DUSTYSHOCK, DUSTYSEDOV and DUSTYDISC, the first three of which have known analytic solutions.  We present the validation of our algorithm against all of these tests. In doing so, we show that the spatial resolution criterion Delta≲csts is a necessary condition in all gas+dust codes that becomes critical at high drag (i.e. small stopping time ts) in order to correctly predict the dynamics. Implicit timestepping and the implementation of realistic astrophysical drag regimes are addressed in a companion paper.},

@article{lodato:2010,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the issue of the propagation of warps in thin and viscous accretion discs. In this regime, warps are known to propagate diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient approximately inversely proportional to the disc viscosity. Previous numerical investigations of this problem did not find a good agreement between the numerical results and the predictions of the analytic theories of warp propagation, both in the linear and in the non-linear case. Here, we take advantage of a new, low-memory and highly efficient smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code to run a large set of very high-resolution simulations (up to 20 million SPH particles) of warp propagation, implementing an isotropic disc viscosity in different ways, to investigate the origin of the discrepancy between the theory and the numerical results. We identify the cause of the discrepancy in an incorrect calibration of disc viscosity in previous investigations. Our new and improved analysis now shows a remarkable agreement with the analytic theory both in the linear and in the non-linear regime, in terms of warp diffusion coefficient and precession rate. It is worth noting that the resulting diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the disc viscosity only for small amplitude warps and small values of the disc alpha coefficient (alpha <~ 0.1). For non-linear warps, the diffusion coefficient is a function of both radius and time, and is significantly smaller than the standard value. Warped accretion discs are present in many contexts, from protostellar discs to accretion discs around supermassive black holes. In all such cases, the exact value of the warp diffusion coefficient may strongly affect the evolution of the system and therefore its careful evaluation is critical in order to correctly estimate the system dynamics.},

	Abstract = {We report the first detection of a gap and a ring in 336 GHz dust continuum emission from the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The gap and ring are located at around 25 and 41 au from the central star, respectively, and are associated with the CO snow line at ~30 au. The gap has a radial width of less than 15 au and a mass deficit of more than 23%, taking into account that the observations are limited to an angular resolution of ~15 au. In addition, the 13CO and C18O J=3-2 lines show a decrement in CO line emission throughout the disk, down to ~10 au, indicating a freeze-out of gas-phase CO onto grain surfaces and possible subsequent surface reactions to form larger molecules. The observed gap could be caused by gravitational interaction between the disk gas and a planet with a mass less than super-Neptune (2{M}{{Neptune}}), or could be the result of the destruction of large dust aggregates due to the sintering of CO ice.},

Methods: .Several improvements to the standard Monte Carlo method are implemented in MCFOST to increase efficiency and reduce convergence time, including wavelength distribution adjustments, mean intensity calculations, and an adaptive sampling of the radiation field. The reliability and efficiency of the code are tested against a previously-defined benchmark, using a 2D disk configuration. No significant difference (no more than 10% and usually much less) is found between the temperatures and SEDs calculated by MCFOST and by other codes included in the benchmark. Results: . A study of the lowest disk mass detectable by Spitzer, around young stars, is presented and the colours of "representative" parametric disks compared to recent IRAC and MIPS Spitzer colours of solar-like young stars located in nearby star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {Aims: Solving the continuum radiative transfer equation in high opacity media requires sophisticated numerical tools. In order to test the reliability of such tools, we present a benchmark of radiative transfer codes in a 2D disc configuration.  Methods: We test the accuracy of seven independently developed radiative transfer codes by comparing the temperature structures, spectral energy distributions, scattered light images, and linear polarisation maps that each model predicts for a variety of disc opacities and viewing angles. The test cases have been chosen to be numerically challenging, with midplane optical depths up 10^6, a sharp density transition at the inner edge and complex scattering matrices. We also review recent progress in the implementation of the Monte Carlo method that allow an efficient solution to these kinds of problems and discuss the advantages and limitations of Monte Carlo codes compared to those of discrete ordinate codes.  Results: For each of the test cases, the predicted results from the radiative transfer codes are within good agreement. The results indicate that these codes can be confidently used to interpret present and future observations of protoplanetary discs.},

In accord with the self-shadowing hypothesis recently proposed by Debes et al., we find that the total and polarized intensity of the disk exhibits strong azimuthal asymmetries at projected distances consistent with the previously reported bright and dark ring-shaped structures (~45--99 au). The sinusoidal-like variations possess a maximum brightness at position angles near ~268$\,^{\circ}$--300$\,^{\circ}$ and are up to ~28% stronger in total intensity. Furthermore, significant radial and azimuthal variations are also detected in the polarization fraction of the disk. In particular, we find that regions of lower polarization fraction are associated with annuli of increased surface brightness, suggesting that the relative proportion of multiple-to-single scattering is greater along the ring and gap structures. Moreover, we find strong (~20%) azimuthal variation in the polarization fraction along the shadowed region of the disk. Further investigation reveals that the azimuthal variation is not the result of disk flaring effects, but is instead from a decrease in the relative contribution of multiple-to-single scattering within the shadowed region. Employing a two-layer scattering surface, we hypothesize that the diminished contribution in multiple scattering may result from shadowing by an inclined inner disk, which prevents direct stellar light from reaching the optically thick underlying surface component.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents splash, a publicly available interactive visualisation tool for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations. Visualisation of SPH data is more complicated than for grid-based codes because the data are defined on a set of irregular points and therefore requires a mapping procedure to a two dimensional pixel array. This means that, in practise, many authors simply produce particle plots which offer a rather crude representation of the simulation output. Here we describe the techniques and algorithms which are utilised in splash in order to provide the user with a fast, interactive and meaningful visualisation of one, two and three dimensional SPH results.},

	Abstract = {Distinct gap features in the nearest protoplanetary disk, TW Hya (distance of 59.5 $\pm$ 0.9 pc), may be signposts of ongoing planet formation. We performed long-exposure thermal infrared coronagraphic imaging observations to search for accreting planets, especially within dust gaps previously detected in scattered light and submillimeter-wave thermal emission. Three nights of observations with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in L' (3.4-4.1 mum) did not reveal any statistically significant point sources. We thereby set strict upper limits on the masses of non-accreting planets. In the four most prominent disk gaps at 24, 41, 47, and 88 au, we obtain upper mass limits of 1.6-2.3, 1.1-1.6, 1.1-1.5, and 1.0-1.2 Jupiter masses (M J), assuming an age range of 7-10 Myr for TW Hya. These limits correspond to the contrast at 95% completeness (true positive fraction of 0.95) with a 1% chance of a false positive within 1" of the star. We also approximate an upper limit on the product of the planet mass and planetary accretion rate of {M}{{p}}\dot{M}≲ {10}-8 {M}{{J}}2 {{yr}}-1 implying that any putative ˜0.1 M J planet, which could be responsible for opening the 24 au gap, is presently accreting at rates insufficient to build up a Jupiter mass within TW Hya's pre-main-sequence lifetime.},

	Abstract = {The mechanism behind angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and whether this transport is turbulent in nature, is a fundamental issue in planet formation studies. Recent ALMA observations have suggested that turbulent velocities in the outer regions of these disks are less than ~0.05--0.1{c}{{s}}, contradicting theoretical predictions of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). These observations have generally been interpreted to be consistent with a large-scale laminar magnetic wind driving accretion. Here, we carry out local, shearing-box simulations with varying ionization levels and background magnetic field strengths in order to determine which parameters produce results consistent with observations. We find that even when the background magnetic field launches a strong largely laminar wind, significant turbulence persists and is driven by localized regions of vertical magnetic field (the result of zonal flows) that are unstable to the MRI. The only conditions for which we find turbulent velocities below the observational limits are weak background magnetic fields and ionization levels well below that usually assumed in theoretical studies. We interpret these findings within the context of a preliminary model in which a large-scale magnetic field, confined to the inner disk, hinders ionizing sources from reaching large radial distances, e.g., through a sufficiently dense wind. Thus, in addition to such a wind, this model predicts that for disks with weakly turbulent outer regions, the outer disk will have significantly reduced ionization levels compared to standard models and will harbor only a weak vertical magnetic field.},

	Abstract = {We study the radial migration of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks analogous to the primordial solar nebula. Our main objective is to determine the retention efficiency of dust particles, which are the building blocks of the much larger planetesimals. This study takes account of the two-dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including the effects of the variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane (higher than a few disk scale heights), the gas rotates faster than the particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the radial direction. Viscous torque induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (size<~100 mum at 10 AU) particles with it. Only particles at intermediate altitude or with sufficiently large sizes (>~1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, the particles have a net inward flux. The magnitude of their radial motion depends on their distance from the central star. At large distances, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease is a function of the particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 mum particles have slower velocity than the gas in the majority of the disk (r<~100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (size<~10 mum) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in an increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase. If the gas disk has a steep radial density gradient or if dust particles sediment effectively to the disk midplane, the net vertically averaged flux of particles can be outward. In this case, the accretion of the dust component is prevented, leading to the formation of residual dust disks after their gas component is severely depleted.},

	Abstract = {Observations of multiple rotational transitions from a single molecule allow for unparalleled constraints on the physical conditions of the emitting region. We present an analysis of CS in TW Hya using the J = 7--6, 5--4 and 3--2 transitions imaged at ~0."5 spatial resolution, resulting in a temperature and column density profile of the CS emission region extending out to 230 au, far beyond previous measurements. In addition, the 15 kHz resolution of the observations and the ability to directly estimate the temperature of the CS emitting gas, allow for one of the most sensitive searches for turbulent broadening in a disk to date. Limits of v turb ≲ 0.1c  s  can be placed across the entire radius of the disk. We are able to place strict limits of the local H2 density due to the collisional excitations of the observed transitions. From these we find that a minimum disk mass of 3 × 10-4 M Sun is required to be consistent with the CS excitation conditions and can uniquely constrain the gas surface density profile in the outer disk.},

	Abstract = {Planets are formed in disks around young stars. With an age of ~10 Myr, TW Hya is one of the nearest T Tauri stars that is still surrounded by a relatively massive disk. In addition a large number of molecules has been found in the TW Hya disk, making TW Hya the perfect test case in a large survey of disks with Herschel-PACS to directly study their gaseous component. We aim to constrain the gas and dust mass of the circumstellar disk around TW Hya. We observed the fine-structure lines of [O i] and [C ii] as part of the open-time large program GASPS. We complement this with continuum data and ground-based 12 CO 3-2 and 13CO 3-2 observations. We simultaneously model the continuum and the line fluxes with the 3D Monte-Carlo code MCFOST and the thermo-chemical code ProDiMo to derive the gas and dust masses. We detect the [O i] line at 63 mum. The other lines that were observed, [O i] at 145 mum and [C ii] at 157 mum, are not detected. No extended emission has been found. Preliminary modeling of the photometric and line data assuming [ 12CO] /[ 13CO] = 69 suggests a dust mass for grains with radius <1 mm of ~1.9 × 10-4 M&sun; (total solid mass of 3 × 10-3 M&sun;) and a gas mass of (0.5-5) × 10-3 M&sun;. The gas-to-dust mass may be lower than the standard interstellar value of 100.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by Principal Investigator consortia. It is open for proposals for observing time from the worldwide astronomical community.Appendix is only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

	Abstract = {Context. Protoplanetary disks around young stars are the sites of planet formation. While the dust mass can be estimated using standard methods, determining the gas mass - and thus the amount of material available to form giant planets - has proven to be very difficult. Hydrogen deuteride (HD) is a promising alternative to the commonly used gas mass tracer, carbon monoxide. However, the potential of HD has not yet been investigated with models incorporating both HD and CO isotopologue-specific chemistry, and its sensitivity to uncertainties in disk parameters has not yet been quantified.  Aims: We examine the robustness of HD as tracer of the disk gas mass, specifically the effect of gas mass on HD far-infrared emission and its sensitivity to the vertical structure. Also, we seek to provide requirements for future far-infrared missions such as SPICA.  Methods: Deuterium chemistry reactions relevant for HD were implemented in the thermochemical code DALI and more than 160 disk models were run for a range of disk masses and vertical structures.  Results: The HD J = 1-0 line intensity depends directly on the gas mass through a sublinear power law relation with a slope of  0.8. Assuming no prior knowledge about the vertical structure of a disk and using only the HD 1-0 flux, gas masses can be estimated to within a factor of two for low mass disks (Mdisk <= 10-3M&sun;). For more massive disks, this uncertainty increases to more than an order of magnitude. Adding the HD 2-1 line or independent information about the vertical structure can reduce this uncertainty to a factor of   3 for all disk masses. For TW Hya, using the radial and vertical structure from the literature, the observations constrain the gas mass to 6 × 10-3M&sun; <= Mdisk <= 9 × 10-3M&sun;. Future observations require a 5sigma sensitivity of 1.8 × 10-20 W m-2 (2.5 × 10-20 W m-2) and a spectral resolving power R >= 300 (1000) to detect HD 1-0 (HD 2-1) for all disk masses above 10-5M&sun; with a line-to-continuum ratio >= 0.01.  Conclusions: These results show that HD can be used as an independent gas mass tracer with a relatively low uncertainty and should be considered an important science goal for future far-infrared missions.},

	Abstract = {We present scattered light images of the TW Hya disk performed with the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch instrument in Polarimetric Differential Imaging mode at 0.63, 0.79, 1.24, and 1.62 mum. We also present H2/H3-band angular differential imaging (ADI) observations. Three distinct radial depressions in the polarized intensity distribution are seen, around ≈85, ≈21, and ≲6 au.21 The overall intensity distribution has a high degree of azimuthal symmetry; the disk is somewhat brighter than average toward the south and darker toward the north--west. The ADI observations yielded no signifiant detection of point sources in the disk. Our observations have a linear spatial resolution of 1--2 au, similar to that of recent ALMA dust continuum observations. The sub-micron-sized dust grains that dominate the light scattering in the disk surface are strongly coupled to the gas. We created a radiative transfer disk model with self-consistent temperature and vertical structure iteration and including grain size-dependent dust settling. This method may provide independent constraints on the gas distribution at higher spatial resolution than is feasible with ALMA gas line observations. We find that the gas surface density in the ``gaps'' is reduced by ≈50% to ≈80% relative to an unperturbed model. Should embedded planets be responsible for carving the gaps then their masses are at most a few 10 {{{M}}}\oplus . The observed gaps are wider, with shallower flanks, than expected for planet--disk interaction with such low-mass planets. If forming planetary bodies have undergone collapse and are in the ``detached phase,'' then they may be directly observable with future facilities such as the Mid-Infrared E-ELT Imager and Spectrograph at the E-ELT.},

	Abstract = {Context. Snowlines in protoplanetary disks play an important role in planet formation and composition. Since the CO snowline is difficult to observe directly with CO emission, its location has been inferred in several disks from spatially resolved ALMA observations of DCO+ and N2H+.  Aims: N2H+ is considered to be a good tracer of the CO snowline based on astrochemical considerations predicting an anti-correlation between N2H+ and gas-phase CO. In this work, the robustness of N2H+ as a tracer of the CO snowline is investigated.  Methods: A simple chemical network was used in combination with the radiative transfer code LIME to model the N2H+ distribution and corresponding emission in the disk around TW Hya. The assumed CO and N2 abundances, corresponding binding energies, cosmic ray ionization rate, and degree of large-grain settling were varied to determine the effects on the N2H+ emission and its relation to the CO snowline.  Results: For the adopted physical structure of the TW Hya disk and molecular binding energies for pure ices, the balance between freeze-out and thermal desorption predicts a CO snowline at 19 AU, corresponding to a CO midplane freeze-out temperature of 20 K. The N2H+ column density, however, peaks 5-30 AU outside the snowline for all conditions tested. In addition to the expected N2H+ layer just below the CO snow surface, models with an N2/CO ratio ≳0.2 predict an N2H+ layer higher up in the disk due to a slightly lower photodissociation rate for N2 as compared to CO. The influence of this N2H+ surface layer on the position of the emission peak depends on the total CO and N2 abundances and the disk physical structure, but the emission peak generally does not trace the column density peak. A model with a total (gas plus ice) CO abundance of 3 × 10-6 with respect to H2 fits the position of the emission peak previously observed for the TW Hya disk.  Conclusions: The relationship between N2H+ and the CO snowline is more complicated than generally assumed: for the investigated parameters, the N2H+ column density peaks at least 5 AU outside the CO snowline. Moreover, the N2H+ emission can peak much further out, as far as  50 AU beyond the snowline. Hence, chemical modeling, as performed here, is necessary to derive a CO snowline location from N2H+ observations.},

	Abstract = {In a centrally condensed solar nebula, the pressure gradient in the gas causes the nebula to rotate more slowly than the free orbital velocity, and drag forces cause the orbits of solid bodies to decay. Their motions have been investigated analytically and numerically for all applicable drag laws. The maximum radial velocity developed is independent of the drag law and insensitive to the nebular mass. Results are presented for a variety of model nebulae. Radial velocities depend strongly on particle size, reaching values of the order of 10,000 cm/s for meter-sized objects. Possible consequences include: mixing of solid matter within the solar nebula on short time scales, collisions leading to rapid accumulation of planetesimals, fractionation of bodies by size or density, and production of regions of anomalous composition in the solar nebula.},

	Abstract = {Water and simple organic molecular ices dominate the mass of solid materials available for planetesimal and planet formation beyond the water snow line. Here we analyze ALMA long baseline 2.9, 1.3 and 0.87 mm continuum images of the young star HL Tau, and suggest that the emission dips observed are due to rapid pebble growth around the condensation fronts of abundant volatile species. Specifically, we show that the prominent innermost dip at 13 AU is spatially resolved in the 0.87 mm image, and its center radius is coincident with the expected mid-plane condensation front of water ice. In addition, two other prominent dips, at distances of 32 and 63 AU, cover the mid-plane condensation fronts of pure ammonia or ammonia hydrates and clathrate hydrates (especially with CO and N2) formed from amorphous water ice. The spectral index map of HL Tau between 1.3 and 0.87 mm shows that the flux ratios inside the dips are statistically larger than those of nearby regions in the disk. This variation can be explained by a model with two dust populations, where most of the solid mass resides in a component that has grown to decimeter size scales inside the dips. Such growth is in accord with recent numerical simulations of volatile condensation, dust coagulation, and settling.},

	Abstract = {We study particle trapping at the edge of a gap opened by a planet in a protoplanetary disk. In particular, we explore the effects of turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability on particle trapping, using global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including Lagrangian dust particles. We study disks either in the ideal MHD limit or dominated by ambipolar diffusion (AD) which plays an essential role at the outer regions of a protoplanetary disk. With ideal MHD, strong turbulence (the equivalent viscosity parameter alpha ~ 10-2) in disks prevents vortex formation at the edge of the gap opened by a 9 MJ planet, and most particles (except the particles that drift fastest) pile up at the outer gap edge almost axisymmetrically. When AD is considered, turbulence is significantly suppressed (alpha <~ 10-3), and a large vortex forms at the edge of the planet induced gap, which survives ~1000 orbits. The vortex can efficiently trap dust particles that span 3 orders of magnitude in size within 100 planetary orbits. We have also carried out two-dimensional hydrodynamical (HD) simulations using viscosity as an approximation to MHD turbulence. These HD simulations can reproduce vortex generation at the gap edge as seen in MHD simulations. Finally, we use our simulation results to generate synthetic images for ALMA dust continuum observations on Oph IRS 48 and HD 142527, which show good agreement with existing observations. Predictions for future ALMA cycle 2 observations have been made. We conclude that the asymmetry in ALMA observations can be explained by dust trapping vortices and the existence of vortices could be the evidence that the outer protoplanetary disks are dominated by AD with alpha < 10-3 at the disk midplane.},
