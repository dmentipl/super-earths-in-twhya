"Ringed Substructure and a Gap at 1 AU in the Nearest Protoplanetary Disk"

The '30mas' file is used as the main image in our Figure 1.  The '20mas' file 
is used as the inset in our Figure 1, and for the representations in Figure 2.  
Please note that the dirty beam for the '20mas' has ~20% sidelobe features 
oriented at approximately 60/240 degrees in position angle (see Sect 2 in the 
article): do not mistake any artifacts these introduce as real features (e.g., 
do not write an article claiming that there are faint streamers of material 
flowing across the 1 AU gap; you will end up having to retract it!).  The 
'Tb_profile.dat' file contains the brightness temperature profile shown in the
bottom panel of Figure 2: the first column is radius in AU, the second column 
is the brightness temperature in K (calculated with the full Planck function, 
rather than the Rayleigh-Jeans approximation).

Other technical questions can be directed to Sean Andrews via email 
(sandrews@cfa.harvard.edu), but I cannot guarantee a response timescale.

Enjoy!
